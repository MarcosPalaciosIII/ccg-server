<!-- about getting an api -->
Simple pets server api.

Finding an API for pets that has decent documentation as for endpoints and usage was a bit challenging and getting it working would take much longer.

Made my own seed file and database in order to get this done quicker.


<!-- about the styling -->
I Know the main goal is to show the information being received from the api using the back-end and grabbing it on the front-end to display but I decided to go ahead and make the page look as close to the original as possible.

The details page for the animals I did not do much styling on as most of my styling skill should be noticed from the landing page of the site.


<!-- Seeding the Database with dummy data -->
As for the information on the site, if you do not see any pets then please use the endpoint /pets/seed in order to seed the database as I may have not seeded it or deleted the current database.


The route for the seeding the database will delete everything in the database and reseed it, so If by chance you see a broken image please do reseed as it is hopefully an error in previous seed.

<!-- seeding locally -->
This page is not for displaying anything, only to seed. Once you seed, click the logo to see all pets.
The endpoint on local is /seed. ```There is no need to do /pets/seed (Do not do this locally)```

<!-- seeding deployed -->
The endpoint mentioned above ``` /pets/seed ``` will return a json format response. So It will either show the info that was seeded or it will show you an error when seeding.


<!-- filters -->

All the filters work together. Feel free to play around with them to see the results that you will get.


<!-- time table -->
When working on this mock site I had a lot going on and did not have much time in the day to complete it and also have things planned for the next day. Therefore the work that you see is what I was able to complete throughout the day while getting things done before having a large number of guest show up the following day (due date).


<!-- final words -->
I hope that you enjoy how the site came out and would like you to let me know if theres anything else I can do to improve this current site clone.

Kind Regards and Happy Coding!
